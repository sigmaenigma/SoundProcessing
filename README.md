# Sound Processing Tools

This is a repository with tools I'm building to study sound. 

The file called pink_noise_generator.py generates pink noise. It creates a .wav file of a certain duration. 

The file called `fft_graph_wav_file.py` takes in a .wav file and generates an FFT plot of the magnitude to validate the sound file generated in `pink_noise_generator.py`

The file called `MorseCodeGenerator.html` is actually for a website and uses JavaScript to convert ASCII to Morse Code and vice versa in addition to playing the Morse Code out loud.
